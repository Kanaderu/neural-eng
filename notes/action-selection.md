## Action Selection

In this lecture, we look at action selection, action execution, and the completion of complex tasks, all with analogies and direct comparisons to the human brain system and human behaviour. 

### Notes

The cortex-basal ganglia-thalamus loop is everything-action selection-action execution.

The Tower of Hanoi is apparently a good complex test of the functioning of a simulated action selection system. Comparison with humans shows similarities, although there seems to be a memory discrepancy in which the computer has to start from scratch by recomputing plans that it had made previously whereas humans would remember them easily.

### Questions

1. What is the basal ganglia and what are its functions?
  * Also called basal nuclei
  * Multiple subcotrical nuclei in vertebrate brains, situated at the base of the forebrain
  * Primarily used for action selection
  * Functions:
    * Voluntary motor control
    * Procedural learning
    * Routine behaviours or habits
    * Eye movements
    * Cognition and emotion
2. What is the thalamus and what are its functions?
  * Brain structure situated between cerebral cortex and the midbrain
  * Fuctions:
    * Relaying sensory and motor signals to cerebral cortex
    * Regulation of consciousness, sleep, and alertness

### Miscellaneous

* The **basal ganglia** is a gangly conductor, with a baton of basil, of the symphony of motor movements that work in tandem to play a piece which is the voluntary or procedural action. The conductor does not play the piece (action), but selects it.
* The **thalamus** is Hermes (thal) great (mus)enger of the Gods as the link to thte Earthly realm. All the Earthly information goes through him, with which he combines the current emotional status of Olympus (limbic system), stress signals from demigods (autonomic nervous system), and creates a message that the Gods (cerebral cortex) take as reality.

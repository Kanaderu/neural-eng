# Week 4
## Temporal Representation

Temporal filtering

Receptors:
* NMDA: Tau = 50-100 ms
* AMPA: Tau = 5 ms (?)

Why use spikes if it introduces noise? (fluctuations in encoding)
* Sending a continuous signal over a longer distance is metabolically expensive due to decay
* Sending spikes and boosting them if they're detected at the end is cheaper
* Small animals (i.e. insects) don't use spikes
* Larger animals use spikes

This lesson and previous lessons are vital as fundamentals in understanding the next lessons.

### Questions
1. What is the cell soma?
2. What is the optimal versus temporal filtering?
3. What is filtering in the neural sense? (i.e. in this context)
4. What is population and temporal coding?

## Transformation

Time to start connecting neurons together.

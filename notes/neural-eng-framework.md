# Neural Engineering: Computation, Representation, and Dynamics in Neurobiological Systems
#### **Authors:** *Chris Eliasmith and Charles H. Anderson*
## Personal Notes

I would like to get as much as I can out of this book; however given my current set of commitments, a thorough read is not possible. I will be skimming through and taking notes of what interests me. In particular, I have a project for the course Professor Eliasmith teaches in which I will be modelling the locomotion and control of a lamprey in a 2-Dimensional plane. From this book I would like to understand the model discussed and understand the requisite knowledge for the implementation and extension of this model.

## Contents

## Chapter 8: Dynamic Transformations

### Section 8.5: Lamprey Locomotion

#### Notes

Lamprey model:
* Isolated spinal cord activates when bathed in excitatory amino acids
  * Spine portions are modeled by *biphasic oscillator* (BPO)
  * Whole spine is chain of BPOs
* Spinal cord is series of *central pattern generators* (CPG)
  * Bottom-up approach

#### Questions

1. What is a *biphasic oscillator* (BPO)?
2. What is a *central pattern generator* (CPG)?
  * Group of neurons that can produce rhythmic patterns without sensory input
  * Lamprey spinal cord is series of CPGs

#### Miscellaneous

* First random tidbit
* Another random tidbit

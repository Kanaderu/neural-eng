# How to Build a Brain: A Neural Architecture for Biological Cognition
#### Author: *Chris Eliasmith*
## Personal Notes on Readings

### Pre-Reading Notes and Questions

I have been taking Professor Chris Eliasmith's course 'Simulating Neurobiological Systems' at the University of Waterloo for a few weeks now, so I have some bias towards what I believe the book will impart upon me. In particular, I'm familiar with some of the technical details of the basis upon which his models are based, however what I am not aware of is the direction and scope of his works. I am hoping to gain a knowledge of the history leading up to current advances in neuroscience and neural modelling, but I also wish to know how close the modelling is to how the brain works, and whether these techniques could be used in other domains.

* Will this book contain technical detail comparable to his book on the Neural Engineering Framework?
* What specific techniques is he using in modelling?
* How computationally efficient are the modelling techniques?
* How much of a gap exists between current technology and realizing a full mammalian brain?
* Are there other techniques that might work more effectively in particular sections of the modelling?
* Is the only goal to simulate a brain as accurately as possible?
* What kind of high-level behaviours have been tested using this model?
* How is working memory dealt with?
    * In particular, how does working memory function in the brain?
    * How is working memory represented as a neural model?
    * What are the mechanisms in working memory in order to maximize its effectiveness?
